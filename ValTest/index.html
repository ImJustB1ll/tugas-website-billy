    <h2>A little about us</h2>
    <h4>Our Pledge</h4>
    <p>
      As part of the Independent and Tested Expeditionary Cinemagrophy division
      (ITEC) it is our sworn obligation to document, identify and otherwise
      explain any anomalies assigned to us, mostly pertaining to The Tainted
      Inheritors designated as 10-PPLG-2.<br /><br />
      *Clarification: 10 = corresponding to which wave caused emergence, PPLG =
      Procedure and Processing: Leave Guarded, 2 = number of wave's subset if
      present.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Our Duty</h4>
    <p>
      To achieve our goals is to consider no task too difficult, no ends too
      loose and no action too unthinkable. Only the complete and whole research
      of Them shall sate us, from which it shall never come. It is for this
      reason we have spent our efforts sending scouting and probing operations
      to best study and identify Them.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Our Lonesome Road</h4>
    <p>
      It is through and for all this that we have created this domain to act as
      the largest acting archive for material relevant to our goal. To act as a
      profile for our struggles and for future cross reference if necessary.
